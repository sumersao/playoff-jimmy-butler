# Is Playoff Jimmy Butler Real?

Project to analyze if playoff Jimmy Butler is a real phenomenon. Read blog post for full methodology here(TODO).

## Data
The data folder contains the csvs imported from: https://github.com/Nathanlauga/nba-data-scrapping. It also contains the two scraping scripts we wrote to collect data from NBA Reference, as well as a python notebook which cleans up and formats the data.

## Methods
1. The `abs_stat_comp_plots.ipynb` and `abs_t_tests.py` files compute all of the absolute stats of Jimmy Butler.
2. The `abs_stat_comp_plots.ipynb` and `abs_t_tests.py`files compute all of the relative rankings between JB and the other NBA players each season.
3. The `historical_delta_plots.ipynb` file computes the plots comparing JB's playoff deltas and compares them against all stars in the last 10 years.
